# OpenGL Engine Test
This is just a pet project of mine. The goal is some sort of
all-in-one first-person fancy-lighting 3D engine. Although
it's more of a learning project.

I'm trying to use only modern OpenGL techniques, combined
with new C++11 stuff. I'm also using the development version
of SFML, so you'll need to have quite new packages to be able
to compile this.

Depends on:

  * libsfml-dev >= 2.0
  * libglew-dev >= ?
  * libglm-dev >= ?
  * gcc >= 4.7 (or any C++11 compatible compiler)
